Abstract

Common self-improvement approaches for large language models (LLMs),
such as STaR, iteratively fine-tune LLMs on self-generated solutions to
improve their problem-solving ability. However, these approaches discard
the large amounts of incorrect solutions generated during this process,
potentially neglecting valuable information in such solutions. To address
this shortcoming, we propose V-STaR that utilizes both the correct and
incorrect solutions generated during the self-improvement process to train
a verifier using DPO that judges correctness of model-generated solutions.
This verifier is used at inference time to select one solution among many
candidate solutions. Running V-STaR for multiple iterations results in
progressively better reasoners and verifiers, delivering a 4% to 17% test
accuracy improvement over existing self-improvement and verification
approaches on common code generation and math reasoning benchmarks
with LLaMA2 models.

Introduction

Learning to recognize and correct mistakes is a feature of human intelligence (Metcalfe,
2017). When dealing with complex tasks, such as coding or solving a math problem, we can
recognize errors in reasoning and explore alternative paths to a solution. To improve the
reasoning performance of LLMs, several approaches exploit the ability of LLMs to produce
solutions and check the correctness of these solutions during training, for example, using
test cases for code generation. These self-improvement approaches, such as STaR Zelikman
et al. (2022), RFT (Yuan et al., 2023), and ReSTEM (Singh et al., 2023), improve LLMs by
fine-tuning them on their self-generated solutions and optionally iteratively running this
process. However, all these approaches are data-inefficient in that they use only correct
solutions, and discard incorrect solutions, which is often a large portion of model-generated
solutions, especially for challenging reasoning tasks.

Orthogonal to self-improvement, another promising direction to improve LLM reasoning is
to use learned LLM verifiers at test time (Cobbe et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2023b). Specifically,
the LLM generates multiple candidate solutions and the verifier ranks these solutions
and selects the best one. Such verifiers are trained by fine-tuning an LLM on a dataset of
solutions generated from a frozen LLM, labeled with either final correctness (ORM, Cobbe
et al., 2021) or step-by-step human annotations (Lightman et al., 2024). Using such verifiers
allows LLMs to trade-off additional test-time compute for better performance.
We propose Verification for Self-Taught Reasoners (V-STaR). The key idea in V-STaR is
to utilize both the correct and incorrect LLM-generated solutions during the iterative self-
improvement process to train a verifier using DPO1 (Rafailov et al., 2023), in addition to
training a LLM as generator using correct solutions (Fig. 1). The iterative self-improvement
process yields progressively improved generators, trained on augmented data, which leads

Figure 1: Generator and verifier training in V-STaR. Left: In each training iteration,
the generator Gt is fine-tuned (from a pretrained LLM) on the current buffer of problem
instances and correct solutions DGEN. Generated solutions that yielded a correct answer are
added to DGEN to be used in future iterations, and all the generated solutions (correct and
incorrect) are added to DVER. The verifier Vt is trained using DPO with a preference dataset
constructed from pairs of correct and incorrect solutions from DVER. Right: At test time,
the verifier is used to rank solutions produced by the generator. Such iterative training and
inference-time ranking yields large improvements over generator-only self-improvement.

to higher quality completions and more challenging negative examples for the verifier
training. At test time, the verifier ranks multiple candidate solutions from the generator
and selects the best one.

We empirically evaluate V-STaR to improve reasoning capabilities of LLMs: (1) Math
problem-solving using GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021) and a subset of MATH (Hendrycks et al.,
2021), and (2) Code-generation using MBPP (Austin et al., 2021) and HumanEval (Chen et al.,
2021). Fine-tuning LLaMA2 (Touvron et al., 2023) and CodeLLaMA (Rozi`ere et al., 2023),
we compare V-STaR to other self-improvement (RFT, STaR) and verification-based meth-
ods (ORM), self-consistency (Wang et al., 2023a), and a non-iterative V-STaR baseline (RFT
+ Verifier) that uses the same number of generation samples to bootstrap a generator and
verifier. V-STaR works remarkably well, leading to 6% to 17% absolute improvement in test
accuracy over prior self-improvement and verification-based methods for math reasoning,
and 4% to 12% in code generation. Notably, 7B V-STaR surpasses base LLaMA2 70B (8-shot)
on GSM8K, and nearly match CodeLLaMA 34B (zero-shot) on HumanEval.

Our contributions are:

• We propose V-STaR, a simple and effective approach, which uses iteratively generated
correct and incorrect solutions from an LLM to train a better generator and verifier.
V-STaR outperforms prior self-improvement approaches (RFT, STaR) as well as ORM
verification (Cobbe et al., 2021) for math reasoning and code generation (Fig. 2). V-
STaR better utilizes adaptive test-time compute for improving performance than strong
baselines – ORM verification, RFT + verifier (Fig. 5), and self-consistency (Fig. 6, left).
• As a secondary contribution, we find DPO to be more effective for training verifiers
than the prevalent ORM approach by Cobbe et al. (2021). We also propose a formula for
Best-of-k (§4.2), akin to Pass@k, to reliably evaluate test performance with verification.

2 Preliminaries

Given a pretrained language model G and the original training data of a task DSFT =
{(x1, y1), (x2, y2), · · · (xN, yN)}, where x is typically a description of a problem and y is the
solution, such as chain-of-thought rationale or generated code. The de facto approach for
such tasks with causal language models is supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with the negative
log-likelihood objective on the training data:

LSFT(G) = − E

where G is also referred to as generator in reasoning tasks. LLMs can be used to generate
high quality chain-of-thought rationales or solutions for a range of tasks. This observation

has motivated using correct generations from the model itself to bootstrap problem-solving
and reasoning abilities (Zelikman et al., 2022; Singh et al., 2023; Yuan et al., 2023).

2.1 Self-improvement approaches

Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR; Zelikman et al., 2022) corresponds to an iterative approach
where a language model improves itself using correctness feedback. In each iteration, one so-
lution ˆy is generated using greedy decoding from the generator G for each problem x in train-
ing dataset D. Having access to test cases or ground truth answers, generated solutions can
z ∈ {0, 1}. A com-
be checked for their binary correctness label z by z = is correct(x, ˆy),
pletion ˆy is labeled correct if it has the same final answer as the ground truth answer for math
problems, or if it passes all the test cases for code generation problems. Only correct solutions
(z = 1) are included in the dataset at iteration j where Dj = {(x1, ˆy1), (x2, ˆy2), · · · (xN, ˆyN)}.
Then, the generator is fine-tuned on this new dataset using (Eq. 1) where DSFT = Dj. This
fine-tuned generator is used in subsequent iterations.
Rejection Sampling Fine-tuning (RFT; Yuan et al., 2023) first fine-tunes a pretrained LM
on the training dataset DSFT to obtain G. For each problem xi, k solutions are sampled
{ ˆyi,j ∼ G(y|xi)}k
j=1 and similar to STaR, only correct generated solutions (z = 1) are kept.
In RFT, the original dataset is then augmented with the correct completions to Dj, and G is
fine-tuned on the new Dj to obtain GRFT. Unlike STaR, RFT is not an iterative approach.
STaR†. Each STaR iteration can be performed similarly to RFT, akin to ReSTEM (Singh et al.,
2023). Since there could be multiple correct solutions for a problem, one could sample k
solutions per problem at each STaR iteration, but this is not prescribed in the original STaR
paper, which we will denote as STaR†for the rest of the paper.

2.2 Test-time verification

Cobbe et al. (2021) trained verifiers, which they refer as outcome-supervised reward model
(ORM), that assess the probability that a candidate solution is correct for a given problem.
At test time, the language model G generates many candidate solutions and the one ranked
highest by the verifier is selected, also known as Best-of-k. To train a verifier V, similar to
RFT, k candidate solutions are sampled from a generator G for each training problem and
labeled for their correctness z to make the verifier training data DVER = {(xi, ˆyi,j, zi,j)}N
i=1,
where zi,j is a binary label indicating whether ˆyi,j is a correct or incorrect solution.
To train the verifier V, Cobbe et al. (2021) fine-tune a LLM on DVER using a combination
of language modeling (Eq. 1) and binary classification. The model is trained to predict ˆyi,j
given xi and zi,j given {xi; ˆyi,j} with the language modeling and the classification objective,
respectively. See §5 for more details.

2.3 Preference learning with DPO

Fine-tuning pretrained LLMs with human feedback can result in large performance gains in
downstream tasks Ouyang et al. (2022); Bai et al. (2022). The typical framework to do so is to

baselines. We report Best-of-64 for verification-based methods and Pass@1 for others. All
methods, except SFT, have access to the SFT baseline model and K = 48 output generations
per problem. STaR† and V-STaR are run for 3 iterations, where each iteration uses K/3 = 16
samples. Verification corresponds to using a test-time verifier trained on K generated com-
pletions from the SFT generator. Numbers above each bar show the absolute improvement
over SFT. (Left) Test accuracy on tasks used for V-STaR training. (Right) Transfer evaluation

collect paired human preferences for a set of input prompts Dpref = {(xi, y+
i=1, train
a reward model using Dpref, and fine-tune the LLM using this reward (Stiennon et al., 2020).
More recently, Rafailov et al. (2023) proposed Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which
does not use a separately trained reward model during fine-tuning. DPO requires supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) a pretrained LLM on the downstream task to obtain GSFT, which is also
used as a reference policy. Given the preference dataset Dpref and GSFT, DPO’s objective
increases the log likelihood, relative to the reference policy, of preferred y+ to dispreferred
y− completions. We present the DPO loss later in Eq. 2, in the context of training verifiers.

3 V-STaR: Verifiers for self-taught reasoners

Existing self-improvement methods, such as RFT, STaR, and ReSTEM, throw away incorrect
model-generated solutions. However, incorrect solutions can also contain valuable infor-
mation: a language model could learn from discrepancies between correct and incorrect
solutions for a given problem, and identify error patterns in generations, enhancing its abil-
ity to provide more accurate solutions. In this work, we propose V-STaR that utilizes both
incorrect and correct generated solutions in an iterative process to train a better generator
and verifier (see algorithm 1 in appendix).

• First, we fine-tune a pretrained LLM Gbase on the original training data DSFT to obtain

generator GSFT.

• Next, we sample k completions for each problem in the training data from the generator

{ ˆyi,j ∼ G(y|xi)}k

j=1, where x ∈ Dquery (see §D for an example).

• Generated solutions are labeled for their correctness z using ground truth answers or
test cases. We use only correct generated solutions (z = 1) to augment the generator
training data DGEN as (xi, ˆyi,j). Both correct and incorrect generated solutions are added
to verifier data DVER with their correctness label as (xi, ˆyi,j, zi,j), so the verifier can learn
from generator’s mistakes.

• In the next iteration t, the generator Gt is obtained by fine-tuning the pretrained model
Gbase on the augmented DGEN. We can sample solutions again from this generator Gt.
This process is repeated for up to T iterations to augment DGEN and DVER iteratively.
• The final generator GT is obtained by using DGEN to fine-tune a pretrained model Gbase.
The verifier VT is obtained by using DVER to further train a model GSFT which was
fine-tuned on the original DSFT.

Figure 3: Pass@1 and Best-of-64 scores for generator-only and verifier-based methods.
Numbers above each bar represent the absolute improvement over RFT. V-STaR[1 Iter]
baseline is trained with data consisting of 3 × 16 completions per query for one iteration
only. STaR†and V-STaR are trained using iterative data collection (i.e. 16 completions
generated per query at each iteration). At test time, Best-of-64 is calculated using Eq. 3 on
128 candidate answers sampled per problem from the generators. V-STaR 7B performs on
par with CodeLLaMA 34B, which has a zero-shot Pass@1 of 55% on MBPP.

In our approach, the original training data is also included as correct solutions in both
generator data and verifier data. The difference between V-STaR training and Cobbe et al.
(2021) is that our verifier training data is collected iteratively, each iteration from a better
generator, while ORM only collects data from a fixed generator that is only fine-tuned on
the original SFT data. We compare to this ORM approach as a baseline, as discussed in §4.1.

3.1 Training verifiers with DPO

Following Cobbe et al. (2021), current LLM verifiers are trained with a combination of
language modeling and binary classification loss (§2.2). These two objectives can be unified
via offline preference learning methods, such as DPO (Rafailov et al., 2023), where the
proximity to the reference policy is a proxy for the language modeling objective while the
classification loss is a proxy for reward modelling. Empirically, we found DPO verifiers to
be better than ORM-style verifiers (§4.4), when using LoRA adapters (Hu et al., 2022).

To use DPO for training verifiers, we construct a preference pair dataset using collected solu-
tions in DVER. We treat correct solutions as preferred and incorrect solutions as not preferred
completions given the problem. Specifically, DVER = {(xi, y+
i=1,
where m is the number of preference pairs which are from the Cartesian product of correct
and incorrect solutions. We train our verifier V using this constructed DVER and the SFT
policy GSFT using the DPO objective, LDPO(V; GSFT):

where σ is the logistic function, and β is a hyper-parameter controlling the proximity to
the reference policy GSFT. The DPO objective steers the verifier towards increasing the
likelihood of correct solutions y+ and decreasing the likelihood of incorrect solutions y− for
a problem x. At inference, we use the likelihood of a generated solution given a problem
under the trained DPO verifier (i.e. V( ˆy|x)) as scores to rank candidate solutions.

4 Empirical results

To demonstrate the effectiveness of V-STaR, we conduct experiments on two widely used
datasets: GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021) for solving math problems, and MBPP (Austin et al.,
2021) for code-generation problems. We also evaluate the transfer generalization perfor-
mance of V-STaR using Hendrycks’ MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021) and HumanEval (Chen
et al., 2021). Specifically, for math reasoning, we only train our generators and verifiers

using GSM8K training data and evaluate them on the whole GSM8K test set and a subset of
MATH test set2. For code generation, we train our models using the MBPP training data
and evaluate them on the full test sets of MBPP and HumanEval.

Models For experiments, we fine-tune LLaMA2 (Touvron et al., 2023) and CodeLLaMA
(Rozi`ere et al., 2023) 7B and 13B models using LoRA (Hu et al., 2022). Generators are trained
with a causal language modeling objective, and our baseline (V-STaR[1 Iter]) and V-STaR
verifiers are trained using DPO. The reference policy GSFT for DPO is trained on the original
training data for 2 and 3 epochs for GSM8K and MBPP, respectively. See §3.1 for details.

Data generation For each iteration, k = 16 completions are sampled per query from the
previous iteration’s generator. For GSM8K, the first iteration samples are from a generator
trained solely on the original GSM8K training data for 2 epochs. For MBPP, this data is
from a 3-shot pretrained CodeLLaMA (see §B). Completions are labeled for correctness by
checking the final answer for math problems and running test cases for coding problems.

4.1 Baselines and metrics

We run V-STaR for 3 iterations and sample k = 16 solutions at each iteration to augment
DGEN and DVER. To assess the gains from our iterative approach, we compare against a
number of baselines (Table 1):
1. SFT: Standard fine-tuning (Eq. 1) on training data without any self-improvement or

test-time verification.

2. STaR†: Bootstrapping a generator by sampling k = 16 completions per query for 3

iterations, see §2.1.

3. RFT: Running STaR†by sampling 3 × 16 completions for only 1 iteration, see §2.1.
4. Verification (SFT + Verifier): Generating 3 × 16 completions using SFT generator to train
a verifier, as described in §2.3. This is similar to ORM verification approach by (Cobbe
et al., 2021) but empirically performs better (Fig. 5).

5. V-STaR [1 Iter]: Bootstrapping a generator and training a verifier for 1 iteration with
k = 3 × 16 completions from GSFT, so that the total generation budget matches V-STaR.
This baseline also corresponds to RFT + Verifier.

6. Self-consistency / Majority Voting (Wang et al., 2023a): An alternative to use test-time
compute without verifiers: sample multiple solutions from STaR†generator and pick the
majority-vote answer.

model (ORM) style verifier 7B models, measured by Eq. 3. Best-of-1 is equivalent to not
having a verifier and is equal to Pass@1 of the generator.

At inference, we generate 128 candidate solutions for each test problem using the generator.
We report Pass@1 accuracy for the generators, which estimates the probability that an
answer randomly sampled from the generator is correct. Best-of-64 accuracy is used for all
verifier-based methods, using the formula in (Eq. 3), as well as the self-consistency baseline.

4.2 Reliable estimation of Best-of-k accuracy

To estimate accuracy with test-time verifiers, Cobbe et al. (2021); Lightman et al. (2024)
repeat the following procedure several times and average the results: sample k solutions,
rank them using a verifier and take the top scoring one as the predicted answer. However,
computing this best-of-k accuracy can have high variance and is expensive. Instead, to
measure the best-of-k accuracy reliably, we propose two methods, akin to how Pass@k is
computed (Chen et al., 2021). To do so, we estimate the probability that out of k samples
drawn without replacement from a fixed set of N (for N > k) samples, the one with the
highest verifier score is correct. The best-of-k is calculated by repeating this process M times
and taking the average. Assuming there are no duplicate verifier scores this can be done
efficiently (see §E in appendix), using the following formula:
(cid:18)N − i − 1

i=0
where [α0, . . . , αN−1] are the binary correctness values (0 or 1) for the N candidates yi sorted

subsets where the top-ranked candidate is yi for all possible values of i ∈ {0, . . . , N − k − 1}.

4.3 V-STaR on Math Reasoning and Code Generation

As shown in Fig. 2, V-STaR shows consistent gains across GSM8K, MBPP, MATH subset
and HumanEval test sets for LLaMA2 7B and 13B models (Fig. 8) over baselines. In math,
we report absolute improvement of 6 to 17% in test accuracy over STaR† and Verification,
and 4 to 12% in code generation tasks. The gains over V-STaR [1 iter] in Fig. 3 show that
iteratively generating solutions to collect verifier training data results in a better distribution
and quality compared to a non-iterative approach with the same generation budget. We
show gains in each iteration of generator and verifier on MBPP in Fig. 7. We also trained a
4th iteration of generator and verifier on MBPP which led to a marginal gain of 0.3%.
Out-of-domain performance of V-STaR. The generators and verifiers trained on MBPP
are evaluated on HumanEval, while those trained on GSM8K are evaluated on a subset
of MATH test set (see Fig. 2 and Fig. 4). In general, we observe lower absolute Pass@1 and
Best-of-64 scores for all methods as these two tasks are considered to be more difficult than
GSM8K and MBPP. That said, Iterative V-STaR outperforms baselines, and V-STaR [1 iter]
on both tasks and across model sizes. Utilizing incorrect solutions to train verifiers results in
large improvements than just bootstrapping with correct model generated solutions using

reasonably large number of candidate solutions. We compute 95% CIs for self-consistency
using 256 trials. Right: Comparing DPO-based generator and verifier for V-STaR 7B,

STaR†or RFT. While we use LoRA adapters due to compute constraints, we hypothesize
that gains from V-STaR could potentially be larger with full parameter fine-tuning.
Best-of-k accuracy. Fig. 5 shows test accuracy for k = 1 to k = 64, calculated from 128
candidate solutions per test problem, for 7B models on both tasks. Best-of-1 is equivalent
to Pass@1 and ignores verifier scores. Best-of-k saturates for k ≥ 16 and the gap between
V-STaR [1 Iter] and V-STaR stays consistent.

4.4 Comparing DPO vs. ORM verifiers

We trained ORM style verifiers, as described in §2.2, with LoRA adapters. These verifiers
did seem to achieve relatively poor performance compared to DPO-based verifiers. Fig. 5a
shows the comparison between the V-STaR [1 Iter] trained with DPO and an ORM style
verifier on the same training data. ORM fails to effectively search through generated
candidate solutions for number of candidates above 4 in the GSM8K task. The ORM style
verifier is also performing worse than our DPO based verifier in MBPP for number of
candidate solutions above 16.

4.5 How many completions can V-STaR be extended to?

Fig. 6 shows the Best-of-K accuracy of V-STaR 7B on GSM8K, measured by Eq. 3 as a function
of k. V-STaR outperforms majority voting (Wang et al., 2023c) at searching over a large
number of candidate solutions (see §F in appendix). While V-STaR is far more effective than
majority voting for k ≤ 64, the performance gap starts to slightly decrease for larger value
of k, similar to performance decay reported in Cobbe et al. (2021). Furthermore, V-STaR can
be used for any problem solving task where we can verify correctness while majority voting
is not applicable to tasks such as code generation. We also tried combining verifier scores
with reranking strategies, such as weighted reranking and weighted majority voting Liu
et al. (2023), but did not observe performance gains.

4.6 Evaluating DPO verifier as a generator

Since DPO fine-tuned models can also be used as generators, we evaluate how good is the
generation ability of DPO verifiers. Fig. 6 shows Pass@1 and Best-of-64 for V-STaR verifier
over training updates, for three different β coefficients for proximity to SFT policy in DPO
objective (§3.1). The verifier’s solving ability starts degrading only after a small number of
training updates. In contrast, using the DPO objective for verification seems to be sample
efficient as the model’s Best-of-64 increases significantly with only 2k training updates.

4.7 Should the verifier be in the training loop?

Optionally, one could train intermediate verifiers at each iteration and filter correct solutions
to include in DGEN and DVER to provide feedback. This step seems more reasonable
with sufficient exploration, that is larger values of k, when sampling k solutions from the
generator in each iteration.

We tried putting the verifier in the training loop to filter correct solutions from the generator
for the next training iteration. To do so, we sampled k = 64 completions per query from the
generator, labeled their correctness, and took only the top 8 based on their verifier score. We
take as many samples from the incorrect set so that the total number of correct and incorrect
completions per query is 16 or less. After running three iterations with verifier in the loop
for MBPP, the final Best-of-64 accuracy and Pass@1 are 53.2 and 46.34 respectively.

Our results suggest that having the verifier
in the training loop does not provide a sub-
stantial gain for this task. V-STaR is simpler
without the verifier in the loop and there is
no need to train a verifier at each iteration;
however we did not experiment with other
tasks and different sampling strategies from
the generator at each iteration. We leave a

4.8 Gains across V-STaR iteration

Fig. 7 shows the improvements achieved
from each iteration of the generator and ver-
ifier on MBPP. The gains are larger across
iterations of verifiers (from Ver.1 to Ver.3)
than iterations of generators which high-
lights the importance of verifiers.

Challenging multi-step reasoning tasks has driven innovative research on LLMs, such as
generating answers given questions via intermediate steps (Wei et al., 2022; Kojima et al.,
2022). A large volume of recent work studies ways to improve the correctness of these
intermediate steps and reducing the cost of arriving at a correct solution.

Self-training and self-improvement. One family of methods, beginning with STaR (Zelik-
man et al., 2022), reinforced self-training (Gulcehre et al., 2023), and rejection fine-tuning
(Yuan et al., 2023), relies on solutions generated by the LLM to update itself. These methods
fine-tune the model on generated solutions that yield a correct answer. ReSTEM (Singh
et al., 2023) view this fine-tuning as expectation-maximization based RL fine-tuning of a
solution-generating agent. Wang et al. (2023a) propose a contrastive loss to make correct
solutions more likely than incorrect ones, while Ni et al. (2023a) propose to use intermediate
states of successful solutions as supervision to improve credit assignment. Discovery of
successful solutions is a difficult exploration problem, and Luong et al. (2024) has shown
that RL-based fine-tuning of a LLM is difficult unless it is initialized by some steps of super-
vised fine-tuning. In An et al. (2023), a more powerful LLM was used to edit the incorrect
rationales generated by a smaller model and provide positive data for its fine-tuning. How-
ever, Huang et al. (2023) argued that LLMs are limited in their ability to correct their own
reasoning. V-STaR is similar to self-improvement methods in that it uses its self-generated
solutions for fine-tuning, but also trains a verifier using these solutions, including both
correct and incorrect ones.

Training verifiers. Verifiers – models that score or rank reasoning chains with the aim
of favouring successful rationales – were introduced for mathematical reasoning tasks by
Cobbe et al. (2021), who proposed to collect correct and incorrect rationales from a tuned

generator and train a verifier. They noted the importance of a large training set for the
success of the method. Uesato et al. (2022) found that process supervision – correctness of the
rationale – enhances the performance of fine-tuned LLMs relative to outcome supervision
– whether the answer is correct or not. Subsequent work correspondingly studied ways
of deriving reward signals for individual reasoning steps (Li et al., 2023; Lightman et al.,
2024; Yu et al., 2023), combining solution-level and step-level verifiers (Zhu et al., 2023), and
augmenting verifiers with auxiliary information, such as results of program execution (Ni
et al., 2023b). In Ma et al. (2023); Wang et al. (2023b), rationale generation is treated as a
graph search problem, either using a stepwise verifier to guide the search or estimating
the quality of steps by Monte Carlo rollouts. In V-STaR, the verifier is trained with DPO,
which enjoys a high sample efficiency (see Fig. 6), and is used for ranking LLM-generated
solutions at test-time.

The manner of training the verifier varies between works. The verifier can be viewed a
reward model trained on human annotations – making the training of a generator that
satisfies the verifier as an instance of RL with human feedback (Ziegler et al., 2019) – or on
synthetic data, leading to forms of RL with AI feedback (Bai et al., 2022; Yang et al., 2023).
The verifier can alternatively be viewed as a generative model, such as by conditioning on
control tokens indicating a positive or negative label of a solution (Korbak et al., 2023) or by
extracting the score as the likelihood of a special token following the candidate solution (Liu
et al., 2023). V-STaR takes the unique approach of using DPO (Rafailov et al., 2023) to
contrast the likelihoods of correct and incorrect solutions under the verifier (see §3.1).

6 Conclusion

We propose V-STaR, a data-efficient and simple to implement approach that utilizes correct
and incorrect generated solutions from an iteratively trained generator to train a strong
verifier. We find training verifiers with DPO to be more effective than the common method
by Cobbe et al. (2021). Our empirical results show the effectiveness of V-STaR over existing
self-improvement and verification-based methods. V-STaR has the potential to improve
existing self-improvement loops on a wide range of problems with access to correctness
feedback during training.

x = Andy walks 50 meters from his house to school. After school, he comes
back to the house and goes to the market. If he walks 140 meters in total,
how many meters is the distance between the house and the market?
ˆy1 = He walks to school and back, which is 2 × 50 meters = 100 meters. So
he walks 140 meters - 100 meters = 40 meters to the market. Answer=40
ˆy2 = If he walks 50 meters from his house to school, and 140 meters in total,
he walks 140 - 50 = 90 meters from the school to the market. Answer=90

F V-STaR vs. majority voting example

x = Every day, Wendi feeds each of her chickens three cups of mixed
chicken feed, containing seeds, mealworms and vegetables to help keep
them healthy. She gives the chickens their feed in three separate meals.
In the morning, she gives her flock of chickens 15 cups of feed. In the
afternoon, she gives her chickens another 25 cups of feed. How many cups
of feed does she need to give her chickens in the final meal of the day if the
size of Wendi’s flock is 20 chickens?

V-STaR solution = Wendi feeds each of her 20 chickens 3 cups of feed per
day for a total of 20x3=60 cups of feed. She gives the chickens 15 cups
in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon for a total of 15+25=40 cups.
Therefore, she needs to give the chickens 60-40=20 cups of feed in the final
meal of the day. Answer=20

Majority voting solution = The total amount of feed Wendi gives the
chickens is 15 + 25 = 40 cups of feed. Wendi has 20 chickens so she needs to
give each chicken 40 / 20 = 2 cups of feed. Answer=2

G Best-of-k using Eq. 3 vs. Best-of-k from Lightman et al. (2024)
